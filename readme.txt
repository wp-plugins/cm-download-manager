The plugin supports watching videos generated from Vimeo Private Video Channels. Once the admin sets the API key for the specified Vimeo account, the plugin will add the option to build several courses/ webinars / channels based on the channels that are already defined in the account. Using shortcodes, the admin can display the videos in any page or post and allow users to view the videos, leave notes, bookmark and receive progress update.
